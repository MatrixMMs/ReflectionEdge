# Advanced Tagging System Revamp - Implementation Plan

## **Conversation Context**
This document captures the complete analysis and implementation plan for the new tagging system revamp discussed in our conversation.

## **Current System Analysis**

### **Existing Tag Structure**
The current system has basic tag groups:
- Setup (Failed Auction, Momentum, Stop Runs, Trend, Mean Reversion)
- Market Condition (Wide Balance, Trend, Tight Range, Erratic, Low/High Volume)
- Management (Fixated on idea, Retry 2, Retry 3 ∞, Giving Up, Impulsive, Flip Hit, Mistake, Didn't see pattern)
- My read on PA (Clear, Inbetweener, Confused)
- Are you getting upset? (No, Slightly, Pissed off)
- Are you ok with your PNL? (Yes, It's bothering me, I'm not okay with PNL)
- Are you wanting to trade NOW? (No desire, Slight urge, I want to trade NOW)
- Entries (Perfect Entry, Entry Early, Entry Late, Entry Should not happened)
- Exits (Perfect Exit, Hold More, Held 2 Long)

### **Current Limitations**
1. No separation between market conditions and trader psychology
2. Limited market context capture
3. No time-based or session-specific tags
4. Missing order flow and microstructure tags
5. No cross-tag analysis capabilities
6. Basic UI that doesn't scale well with many tags

## **New Tagging System Design**

### **Objective Tags: The Market's Story (What is happening?)**

#### **1. Macro Environment**
- Pre-FOMC Drift: The quiet, often directional action leading into a Fed announcement
- Post-FOMC Volatility: The explosive, multi-directional movement after the announcement
- Major Data Release: For NFP, CPI, PPI, etc. Can be sub-tagged with In-line, Beat, Miss
- Fed Speak: A scheduled speech by a Fed member is influencing price
- Geopolitical Event: A major news event driving unexpected volatility

#### **2. Time of Day & Session**
- Globex Session: Trading during the overnight session
- London Open Crossover: The period of overlap with European markets
- Pre-Market: The 1-2 hours before the US cash session open
- RTH Open Drive: A strong, directional move right from the 9:30 AM EST open
- RTH Mid-day Chop: The low-volume, range-bound period often between 11:30 AM and 1:30 PM EST
- RTH Closing Hour: The increased activity leading into the 4:00 PM EST close

#### **3. Market Structure & Profile Context**
- Inside Value: Trading within the prior day's Value Area (VA)
- Outside Value: Trading outside the prior day's VA
- Value Area Migration: Value is clearly shifting higher or lower day-over-day
- P-shaped Profile: Short-covering rally
- b-shaped Profile: Long-liquidation break
- Balance / Multi-day Balance: Price is contained within a well-defined range over several days
- Trend Day (Open-Drive): Price moves directionally all day, never returning to the opening range
- Failed Breakout: Price broke a key level but failed to find acceptance and reversed
- Gap Rules: Can be sub-tagged with Gap Fill, Gap & Go, Gap Rejection
- IB Break: A break of the Initial Balance (the first hour's range)
- POC Acceptance/Rejection: Price is interacting with a key Point of Control (daily, weekly)

#### **4. Order Flow & Volume Dynamics**
- High Volume Node (HVN) Test: Price is interacting with a high-volume area on the profile
- Low Volume Node (LVN) Traversal: Price is moving quickly through a low-volume area
- Absorption: Large passive orders are absorbing aggressive market orders at a key level (seen on DOM/Footprint)
- Exhaustion: Volume dries up at the peak/low of a move, signaling a potential reversal
- Delta Divergence: Price is making a new high/low, but the cumulative delta (net buying/selling) is not confirming it
- Large Lot Sweep: A significant market order sweeps multiple levels of the book
- Stop Cascade: A series of stop-loss orders being triggered in succession

#### **5. Inter-market & Volatility**
- /NQ Lead: Nasdaq is clearly stronger/weaker, leading the S&P 500
- /ES Lead: S&P 500 is leading the Nasdaq
- Rates Correlation: Yields (ZN, ZB) are moving in a way that is impacting equities (e.g., yields up, NQ down)
- VIX Spike / Collapse: The VIX is moving sharply, indicating a change in expected volatility
- Low Volatility Grind: The VIX is low and the market is slowly trending

### **Subjective Tags: The Trader's Story (How did I react?)**

#### **1. Mental State & Clarity**
- In the Zone / Flow State: Effortless focus, seeing the market clearly, executing flawlessly
- Mentally Fatigued: End of day/week, making lazy mistakes
- Distracted: Phone, news, chatroom, or other people on the desk are breaking my focus
- Confirmation Bias: Only looking for information that supported my pre-existing thesis
- Recency Bias: Over-weighting the last few trades/market movements in my analysis
- Read Was Clear: My thesis was unambiguous and based on my plan
- Read Was Unclear / Forced: I didn't have a strong thesis but traded anyway

#### **2. Emotional Response**
- FOMO Chase: Entered late because I couldn't stand missing the move
- Revenge Trading: Trying to make back a loss from a previous trade with a lower-quality setup
- Euphoria / Overconfidence: Feeling invincible after a string of wins, leading to oversized or sloppy trades
- Anxiety / PnL Watching: Staring at my profit/loss instead of the market action, causing me to exit too early or too late
- Hesitation: Saw my signal but was too afraid to execute

#### **3. Execution & Management Process**
- Followed Plan: Executed the trade exactly as planned, regardless of outcome
- Deviated from Plan: I had a plan but did something else
- Impulsive Entry / No Plan: Traded based on a gut feeling with no pre-defined setup or risk
- Sized Correctly: Risk size was appropriate for the setup's quality and my conviction
- Oversized: Took on too much risk, usually driven by emotion
- Undersized: Didn't take on enough risk, usually driven by fear/hesitation
- Honored Stop: My stop-loss was hit and I accepted the loss without question
- Widened Stop: Moved my stop further away as price moved against me (a cardinal sin)
- Moved to BE Prematurely: Moved my stop to break-even too soon, getting stopped out on noise before the real move
- Greed Exit: Held for an unrealistic target and gave back significant open profits
- Fear Exit: Exited a good position on normal pullback/noise, leaving a lot on the table

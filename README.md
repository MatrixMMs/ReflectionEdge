# Reflection Edge - Advanced Trading Performance Tool

A powerful, secure, and professional-grade trading journal built with React for in-depth performance analysis and execution discipline. Go beyond simple P&L tracking and discover your true statistical edge while building consistent trading habits.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Reflection Edge separates **process quality** from **outcome quality**. A trade can be executed perfectly (following your plan) but still lose money, or executed poorly but still make money. Our execution grading system helps you focus on improving your discipline rather than just chasing profits.

## üß† **NEW: Monkey Brain Suppressor (MBS) - In-Session Trading Panel**

### **What It Does**

- **Emoji mood picker**: Select from 7 moods for each trade (from üò° to ü§©)
- **Smart prompts & reflections**: After each trade, receive context-aware journaling prompts; reflections are saved and shown in your session history

## üéì **Execution Grading System**

### **What It Does**
- **Automatically grades** your trade execution from A+ to F
- **Separates discipline from outcomes** - a losing trade with perfect execution gets a good grade
- **Provides immediate feedback** on your trading discipline
- **Tracks improvement over time** to show if your habits are getting better

### **How It Works**
1. **Create a Playbook Strategy** with specific checklist items
2. **Log a Trade** and complete the execution checklist
3. **Get Automatic Grading** based on checklist adherence and trade outcome
4. **Analyze Performance** with visual charts showing P&L by grade

### **Grade Scale**
- **A+**: 90-100% adherence + Winning trade
- **A-**: 90-100% adherence + Losing trade
- **B+**: 75-89% adherence + Winning trade
- **B-**: 75-89% adherence + Losing trade
- **C+**: 60-74% adherence + Winning trade
- **C-**: 60-74% adherence + Losing trade
- **D**: 50-59% adherence (regardless of outcome)
- **F**: Below 50% adherence (regardless of outcome)

### **Execution Dashboard**
- **Performance by Grade Chart**: Visualize the financial impact of good vs. poor execution
- **Grade Statistics**: See trade counts and total P&L for each grade level
- **Trend Analysis**: Track your discipline improvement over time
